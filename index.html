        <h1><em>GAME OF THRONES</em></h1>
        <p>
          The first major arc concerns the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of
          Westeros through a web of political conflicts among the noble families
          either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from
          whoever sits on it. A second focuses on the last descendant of the
          realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos and is
          plotting to return and reclaim the throne. The third follows the
          Night's Watch, a military order defending the realm against threats
          from beyond Westeros's northern border.

          House Stark of Winterfell is one of the Great Houses of Westeros and
          the principal noble house of the north. In days of old they ruled as
          Kings of Winter, but since Aegon's Conquest they have been Wardens of
          the North and ruled as Lords of Winterfell. Their seat, Winterfell, is
          an ancient castle renowned for its strength.

          House Lannister of Casterly Rock is one of the Great Houses of Seven
          Kingdoms, and the principal house of the westerlands. Their seat is
          Casterly Rock, though another branch exists in nearby Lannisport.
          Their sigil is a golden lion on a field of crimson. Their official
          motto is "Hear Me Roar!" However, their unofficial motto, equally well
          known, is "A Lannister always pays his debts." The Warden of the West
          is a Lannister by tradition. Their gold mines have made the Lannisters
          the wealthiest of the Great Houses.

          House Baratheon of Storm's End is one of the Great Houses of Westeros,
          and is the principal house in the stormlands, which they rule as Lords
          Paramount of the Stormlands. Their seat, Storm's End, is an ancient
          castle raised by the Storm Kings from the now-extinct House Durrandon.
          The Baratheon sigil is a crowned black stag on a field of gold.
          Members of the family tend to be tall and powerfully built, with black
          hair and blue eyes, as well as strong, square jawlines. They are known
          for their mercurial tempers, and their words are "Ours is the Fury".

          who once ruled the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. The Targaryen sigil is
          a three-headed dragon breathing flames, red on black. The house words
          are "Fire and Blood". It eventually became the first royal house of
          the Seven Kingdoms, as House Targaryen of King's Landing.

          over the Iron Islands, a harsh and bleak collection of forbidding
          islands off the west coast of Westeros, from the Seastone Chair in the
          castle of Pyke on the island of the same name. The head of the family
          is traditionally known as the Lord Reaper of Pyke. Their sigil is a
          golden kraken on a black field, and their house motto is "We Do Not
          Sow."
